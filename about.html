  <section class="about">
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m David, the owner and founder of <strong>Gator Tech Den</strong>. Technology has always been my passion, and I’ve spent years helping people repair, upgrade, and get the most out of their computers and devices.</p>
  
    <p>Currently, Gator Tech Den is a growing local business that I operate independently. Many repairs are scheduled ahead of time so I can give each device the attention it deserves. My vision is to grow this into a full-time computer repair shop that Waco residents can rely on.</p>
    
    <h2>Our Values</h2>
    <p>At Gator Tech Den, we believe in <strong>clear communication, honest pricing, and quality service</strong>. Whether you’re a student, gamer, or small business owner, we treat every device like it’s our own. No hidden fees, no unnecessary upsells—just trustworthy repairs and IT support.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Us?</h2>
    <p>We’re more than just a repair service. We’re your local <strong>tech partner in Waco, TX</strong>. From virus removal and upgrades to custom PC builds and data recovery, our goal is to keep your devices running smoothly so you can focus on what matters most.</p>
