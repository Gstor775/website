<section class="about">
  <p>Hi, I’m David, the owner of <strong>Gator Tech Den</strong>. 
     Technology has always been my passion, and I’ve spent years helping people 
     repair, upgrade, and get the most out of their computers.</p>
  
  <p>As of currently, this is a one man operation that I have started on the side to start building my own buisness.
     I want to be able to do this full time, but until then most of the work i can do will have to be scheduled ahead of time.
     Thank you for your understanding in this!
    
  <p>At Gator Tech Den, we believe in <strong>clear communication, honest pricing, and quality service</strong>. 
     Whether you’re a student, gamer, or small business, we treat every device like it’s our own.</p>

  <p>We’re more than just computer repair – we’re your local tech partners. 
     Our goal is to keep your devices running smoothly so you can focus on what matters most.</p>
